# Angular-1.x-ui-router-Demo-App

This is a simple application created using AngularJS 1.x for demonstrating the usage of UI Router. For demo purposes, a combination of nested states, named views, direct integration using 'template' as well as separate file using 'templateUrl' has all been used. Not much attention has been given to styling and hence Bootstrap has been used to make the job easier. Also, AngularJS has been imported using CDN.
